## Description

<p> Team One was hired and tasked by Flooring Incorporated to create a portable, dynamic robust Android application that is meant to alleviate supply chain and inventory issues. Flooring Incoporated disclosed that the company was having issues ensuring that suppliers and management had an up-to-date working inventory. This has resulted in a less than ideal situation when dealing with supplier and client relationships. This additionally has resulted in profit losses pertaining specifically to the warehouse's inventory. This has caused conflicts between Flooring Incorporated and the stores it supplies, and in turn has caused a trickling down impact between the local stores and it's everyday consumers.

As such, Team One is currently developing the Android application called <b>Flooring Icon Management</b> or <b>FIM</b>, which seeks to alleviate the supply chain issues that Flooring Icon Incorporated is dealing with. <b>FIM</b> will be a robust, dynamic inventory system that will serve several purposes: (1) It will provide management with an up-to-date inventory list of all the stores that it serves _still in production_ (2) It will provide management with the capability to update and edit the specific store's inventories in real time _still in production_ (3) It will provide a reliable, intuitive easy user interface that management can quickly learn to allow for a smooth transition from its previous system (4) <b>FIM</b> will have the capability to serve management as well as provide everyday consumers the capability to quickly search inventory at a specific store (5) Continuing from point four(4) <b>FIM</b> will be secure system, with two seperate types of users(employee and consumer) that will have different capabilities.

The <b>FIM</b> Android Application system is meant to be used on any type of mobile device that supports the Android operating system, to ensure that real-on-time capabilties and assurances are met. <b>FIM</b> was created with management and consumers alike, and more importantly, their time and money! This simple guide will help you get started using <b>FIM</b>, and make sure you use the application as intended.

## FAQ

<h4 style="color:purple;font-weight:bolder">Question1: What happens if I can't find an item in your database inventory?</h4>

<b>Q1:</b>FIM was designed to allow for inventory to be added as needed. We understand that life is full of surprises, and as such, we have given FIM the robust ability to edit, and add new invntory as needed. Our vendor's employees will be able to add, edit inventory as needed! Where our everyday users will be restricted from taking such action. Life happens fast, don't fret, we are just as fast!

<h4 style="color:purple;font-weight:bolder">Question2: What is the difference between a User and Employee?</h4>

<b>Q2:</b> The FIM was designed for two seperate different workflows. Everyday user(s) will be able to utilize the system upon registering! If you happen to be management, our team will ensure that you are registered with the necessary permissions. This will permit all Employees with the extra capabilties that were discussed above! Rest assurred that our users, as well as our vendor's employees are given the proper access.

<h4 style="color:purple;font-weight:bolder">Question3: Is the FIM application fully functional?</h4>

<b>Q3:</b> Unfortunately, not at this time. Due to time constraints and unforseen budgetary restrictions certain aspects of FlooringIconManager are still being implemented.
