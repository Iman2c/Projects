**Author**: Joceline Garcia, Team 1

## 1 Introduction
The goal of this project is to design an application that helps Floor Icon Inc. keep better track of their inventory across all their stores.

## 2 Process Description
Activity 1: LOGIN <br />
Users log in into the application by entering their account information. Once the users has entered their information they would click the log in button to access home page. If user doesn't have account they can create one by using a username and password. This log in option also allows us to identify employee which get extra access to certain things such as editing, adding, and deleting product.

Activity 2: EMPLOYEE <br />
Employees can edit/add/delete products in the system. When performing this employees must enter category and type of product they want to access, then it is displayed and they are given the option to add a product by entering its name, category and type. They can also edit/delete by selecting the appropriate one. The entrance criteria for this activity is having the employee perform these operations after logging in, this way customers and employees can be differentiated. Employee activity also contains a search function. The exit criteria for the activity is the Employee completing the operation. Once it is successfully created or updated, the activity can be considered completed satisfactorily.

Activity 3: USER <br />
Contains search function that displays the amount product and different types available in the store. Entering criteria for this is when the user logs in they are given the option to search and view products. The exiting criteria is the user successfully searching for products as well and seeing the quantity available in stock.Once this is done the activity can be completed.
